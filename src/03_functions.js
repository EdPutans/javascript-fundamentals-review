// 2. Create a function called "add". It takes 2 numbers as an argument and returns its sum.

// 3. Create a function called "subtractWithCheck". This time:
// - It can expect any 2 arguments
//  - It should return the difference of the 2 arguments if they are numbers
//  - If one of the arguments is not a number, it should return "Yo dawg you can't subtract us!"
