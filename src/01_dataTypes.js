/**
 * @description This is a test to see how well you understand data types in javascript.
 * Write your solutions right below the comments. Use any tools you need to check the answers
 *
 * Don't remove the comments, Ed needs to know what's going on.
 *
 * As tempting as it may be, don't look in the previous exercises for answers. I don't care if you can open them.
 * I care if you can do these yourself ðŸ˜Š
 *
 * If you get stuck on a task - that's good. It means that we're not wasting time here.
 * Note it and skip it. We will later cover it in a 1x1 session and make sure you udnerstand it :P

// 1. create a constant called 'pi' and assign it the value of 3.14

// 2 create a variable called 'radius' and assign it the value of 10
// 2.1 now, change its value to 20

// 3. create a variable called 'area' and calculate the area using your variables
//   The formula is: area = pi x radius-squared

// 4. Create an array called 'garage' with these cars inside:
//   - volvo
//   - audi
//   - mercedes
//   - bmw

// Now, without manually typing the array:
// 4.1 add 'ferrari' to the garagae
// 4.2 remove Mercedes from the array
// 4.3 replace the 2nd car in the array with 'lada'
// 4.4 create an array with all of the cars in the garage capitalized
// 4.5 find the volvo. pretend you don't know what the array looks like.

// 5 Create an object called 'myself' with these properties and assign them your values.
// Use appropriate datatypes for the values:
//   - name
//   - age
//   - isHungry
//   - favouriteAnimal

// 5.1 Replace the favouriteAnimal with 'turtle'
// 5.2 add an address property, which tracks your city, country and street name
// 5.3 add a list of favouriteFoods to the object. Add your favourite foods to the list (duhhh!)
// 5.3 remove the age property
// 5.4 Have a snack. Set isHungry to false (even if you're not really hungry).
